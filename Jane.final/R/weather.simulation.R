#'weather simulation function
#'
#'This function simulate the weather forecast in Richmond,If a day is sunny, the probability that the next day is sunny is 0.85. If a day is rainy, the probability that the next day is rainy is 0.35. If a day is rainy, the amount of rainfall accumulation in the city is governed by an Exponential(Î»=2) distribution, where the value from that distribution is the rainfall in inches. If a day is sunny, there can be no rain
#' @param  initial: weather condition on the initial day
#' @keywords weather.simulation
#' @return the number of projected sunny days in the next 10 days, as well as the projected rainfall accumulation
